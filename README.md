## Quick start

- Install dependencies: run `yarn` in project root
- For dev server: run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`, from project root. The app should be running at: http://localhost:3000.
- To build frontend run: `yarn build` or `npm run build` from project root. Run `yarn start` or `npm start` to start app.

## Notes

- Repo was set up using my personal Hasura and Firebase configurations which is not included. So some setup is required for this repo to work for you.
- You will need to edit the `.env` file to add your credentials
- You also need to update the graphql directory with your own queries and mutations

## Deploy

- Uses [now-sapper](https://github.com/thgh/now-sapper)
- To deploy on Now v2: run `yarn deploy` or `npm run deploy`,

## TODO

- [ ] Add [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) when supported
